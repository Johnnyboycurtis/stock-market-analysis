Just some exploratory data analysis of some stocks and some backtesting of investment strategies.


## Buy and Hold Strategy

Buy and hold strategies perform surprisingly well, often outperforming traders. I try to research if a vanilla buy and hold (aka no thought, just buy) strategy could be improved on with downturn (aka buy the dip) buying.

Not surprisingly, vanilla buy and hold is pretty robust.
